# Croissant Breakfast Sandwich

This can be thrown together fast, like in 10 minutes or less.

## INGREDIENTS
    - 1 Costco (Kirkland) butter croissant  
    - 2 or 3 links of pork breakfast sausage (Farmer John skinless links is a good one and available at Target)
    - 1 slice havarti cheese  
    - 1 egg  
    - butter
    - Plochman's yellow mustard  
    - salt & pepper  
    - sage (optional)  
    
## PROCEDURE

Defrost sausage if frozen (microwave at 90 seconds for 30% power). Remove any paper wrapings around the links.
    
Heat butter in a pan, throw sausage in. About 8 - 12 minutes total. In my Tramontina aluminum non stick skillet, I use low-medium heat but the sausage still cooks very fast, maybe 8 minutes total.  

Meanwhile…cut croissant in half using a bread knife or a steak knife. Optionally toast it, especially if it's going a bit stale—just be careful if you use a toaster so it doesn't burn.  

Flip the sausages if you haven't already.

Mix up an egg.

Put the slice of cheese on one of the croissant halves.  

Put cooked sausage on top of the cheese. This will get it melting.  

Using the same pan with the remaining grease, cook your scrambled egg. Some salt and pepper is recommended. A bit of sage can work too.  

Put the cooked scrambled egg on top of the sausage.   

Apply mustard on the remaining croissant half and place it as the top bread of the sandwich.
