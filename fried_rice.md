# Fried Rice (or Orzo)  
   
## INGREDIENTS   

    - 1 to 2 cups cooked rice (or cooked orzo)
    - cooked chicken or salmon  
    - ~2 tablespoons coconut oil and/or extra virgin olive oil
    - 1 small onion or a few shallots and/or green onion bulbs, chopped
    - 1 carrot, peeled and diced
    - 2-4 cloves garlic, minced
    - fresh basil leaves (Optional. Even better if it's Thai basil.)
    - bell peppers, chopped (optional)
    - sprouts (optional)
  
### SAUCE  
	- 1 tbsp white wine
	- a dash of fish sauce (or maybe oyster sauce if there's broccoli in this)  
	- 1 teaspoon soy sauce (or one packet from takeout)  
	- 1 teaspoon sesame oil  
	- 1/4 tsp white pepper
	  
### AROMATICS  
    - 1/8 - 1/2 teaspoon Bird's Eye chili pepper powder (Sonoran Spice Company based in Arizona makes a really good one).
	- 1/4 teaspoon SHICHIMI TOGARASHI (they have this at HMart)  
    - 1/2 teaspoon Vegeta (This is a spice mix from Croatia. I recommend the tin you can order from Amazon. You want the kind that has MSG in it.)  
    - 1/4 teaspoon salt (if you used Vegeta you probably don't need any extra salt)
	- 1/8 teaspoon of Chinese five spice (optional, can be a bit too much depending on what other stuff you've got in here)          
  
### LATER VEGETABLES  
    - 1-2 Thai hot chili peppers chopped up
    - frozen peas (the best are Bird's Eye Baby Sweet Peas, not to be confused with the previously mentioned Bird's Eye chili pepper)
    - alt vegetables: tomatoes
    - alt vegetables: broccoli
  
### OTHER STUFF
    - 1 egg 
    - 2 green onions (aka scallions) or chives, thinly sliced 
  
## PROCEDURE   
  
If doing chicken: Marinate the chicken with 1/2 teaspoon of five spice powder(?), white pepper powder, a tablespoon of soy sauce and salt for 10 minutes (optional).
  
Sauté:  

    - onions/shallots

Deglaze as needed with a bit of white wine throughout cooking.

After a few minutes…

Add chicken or salmon. (If this is uncooked chicken then it needs to cook for several minutes.)  
  
Add LATER VEGETABLES.  
Cook for 1-6 minutes depending on types of vegetables.    

Add rice/orza.  
Add SAUCE ingredients.  
Add scrambled egg, either cooked in a separate pan or do it in a section of the large pan.
