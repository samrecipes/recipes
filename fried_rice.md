# Fried Rice (or Orzo)  
   
## MAIN INGREDIENTS   

    - 2 Minute Instant Jasmine Rice cups (8.8 oz total) and/or left-over takeout Chinese food rice (or cooked orzo)
    - cooked chicken or salmon  
    - 2 tablespoons coconut oil  
    - 1 small onion or a few shallots, finely chopped
        - One combo that works well is some chunky chopped white onion and chopped parts of the bulb part of green onions (and then after cooking you can add in the chopped green stalks of the green onions).
    - 1 carrot, peeled and cut into slices or dice (pickled carrots work too)
    - 2-4 cloves garlic, minced (I like to do super-thin slices like they do in the movie Goodfellas).  
    - fresh basil leaves (Optional. Even better if it's Thai basil.)
  
## SAUCE  
	1 tbsp white wine
	a dash of fish sauce (or maybe oyster sauce if there's broccoli in this)  
	1 teaspoon soy sauce (or one packet from takeout)  
	1 teaspoon sesame oil  
	1/4 tsp white pepper
	  
## AROMATICS  
    1/8 - 1/2 teaspoon Bird's Eye chili pepper powder (Sonoran Spice Company based in Arizona makes a really good one, and it can be ordered on Amazon). Use less depending on how many fresh hot chiles you add. 
	1/4 teaspoon SHICHIMI TOGARASHI (they have this at HMart)  
    1/2 teaspoon Vegeta (This is a spice mix from Croatia. I recommend the tin you can order from Amazon. You want the kind that has MSG in it.)  
    1/4 teaspoon salt (if you used Vegeta you probably don't need any extra salt)  
	1/8 teaspoon of Chinese five spice (optional, can be a bit too much depending on what other stuff you've got in here)          
  
## LATER VEGETABLES  
    frozen peas (the best are Bird's Eye Baby Sweet Peas, not to be confused with the previously mentioned Bird's Eye chili pepper)  
    alt vegetables: tomatoes and peppers  
    alt vegetables: broccoli
  
## OTHER STUFF
    1 egg 
    2 green onions (aka scallions), thinly sliced (or dried chives but won't be as good)
  
=====================================================  
  
If doing chicken: Marinate the chicken with 1/2 teaspoon of five spice powder(?), white pepper powder, a tablespoon of soy sauce and salt for 10 minutes (optional).
  
Sauté:  
	1/2 tbsp oil  
	Onions/shallots first. Carrots too.  
      
After at least five minutes…
      
	1/2 tbsp oil  
	Add garlic.  
	Add AROMATICS.  
      
After a few minutes…

	Add chicken or salmon. (If this is uncooked chicken then it needs to cook for several minutes.)  
  
Add LATER VEGETABLES.  
Cook for 1-6 minutes depending on types of vegetables.  
  
Add rice/orza.  
  
Add SAUCE ingredients.  
  
Egg: Push the stuff to the side of the pan and add remaining 1/2 tbsp oil. Break the egg into the oil, use a spatula to scramble the egg, breaking it up into small bits (or you can cook egg in a separate pan and then chop it up and throw it in the bigger pan).  
  
Add the scallions or chives OR Thai Basil
