# Deviled Eggs  
  
3 tbsp mayo  
1 tsp mustard (Plochman's Original Mild Classic Yellow)  
1 tsp vinegar (apple cider vinegar)  
salt & pepper  
paprika (garnish)  
  
Note: removing the egg yolk from the white should be easy, you just have to pull back on the top & bottom edges and/or squeeze it slightly and it should pop out.
