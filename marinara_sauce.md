# MARINARA SAUCE

1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil  
1 small onion, finely chopped  
carrot, chopped  
2 - 3 garlic cloves, finely chopped  
1/2 teaspoon hot red pepper flakes (Optional. I've been reducing these in my diet because there's a lot of useless seeds in most pepper flakes, which have natural toxins and they don't actually contain any heat.)  
1 can San Marzano tomatoes including juices (crush them if not already crushed)  
1 cup water (pour it into the can so you get tomatoey water).  
1 can tomato paste  
1/4 cup petite diced tomato  
a few spoons of fire roasted red bell peppers (the best ones being Peruvian, you can get large cans of them from Amazon: Roland Foods Fire-Roasted Red Pepper Strips)  
1/2 cup white wine  
2 teaspoons dried oregano   
basil (only if fresh). If not fresh then don't add until after cooking.  
1/2 teaspoon salt  
1/2 teaspoon black pepper  
1 dried bay leaf  

------------------

In large pan (note you don't want a "sauce pan" or a pot, you want something wider and more shallow):  
  
Saut√© onions & carrots 10 minutes or till onions are translucent.  
  
Add in garlic & red pepper flakes.  
  
Cook 3 minutes (don't burn the garlic).  
  
Add everything else including the water--we need it extra watery because that will evaporate as it cooks.  
  
Simmer at least 1 hour (you can do less but it will be more chunky).  
Leave cover half on so the water doesn't evaporate too fast.  
Add more water if it reduces too much.  
  
Remove bay leaf.  
  
Add some dried basil (optional).
