## Asian-inspired Steak Meal

Marinade:  
    - Ponzu  
    - Olive oil  
    - Sesame oil  
    - Rice wine vinegar  
    - Ginger powder  
    - Honey  
    - Garlic cloves, chopped  
    - Chili powder  

Steak:  
    I used two petite sirloins. After marinating the steak, put some of the marinade in a small pot and boil to use as a sauce.

Bake in oven:  
    - potato, russet, sliced into disks  
    - broccoli (I use frozen)  
    - garlic chunks  
    - spicy Thai chili peppers (chopped)  
    - olive oil  
    - salt & pepper?  
  
Meanwhile caramelize:  
    - white onions, chopped  
   
Pan fry the steak.   
   
Put it on a plate: onions on top of the steak, pour the sauce over everything (optional).
  
## beef w/ basil  
  
using fresh italian basil  
  
Make a small cup of cooking sauce for later:  
    - chopped garlic  
    - ponzu -- will that conflict with the Worcestershire sauce?  
    - Worcestershire sauce      
  
Marinade petite steaks for 15 minutes.  
    - chopped fresh basil  
    - olive oil  
    - ponzu -- will that conflict with the Worcestershire sauce?  
    - Worcestershire sauce  
    - black pepper  
          
in pan with coconut oil:  
    cook up onions till caramelized (13 min). Optional: cook another 4 min with 1 tablespoon brown sugar.  
    cook chunky sliced bell peppers and chunky garlic  
    remove from pan  
        
in pan with more coconut oil:  
    cook steaks   
    For last 60 seconds of cooking add some whole fresh basil leaves.
