# Tomato Sauce with Green Onion  
    
## INGREDIENTS    
    - 1-2 green onions chopped (remove roots and bad ends first; use both the white bulb parts and the green stalks)  
    - sliced bell pepper (about 1/3 of a seeded pepper)  
    - 1-2 cloves garlic  
    - 1 can (14.5 oz) petite diced tomatoes  
    - garlic powder  
    - oregano (optional)  
    - basil (optional)  
    - coconut oil (refined)  
    - white wine  
    - cheese (Dubliner works well although it sticks to the spoon a bit)  
    - meat (optional, I used precooked chicken)  
      
## PROCEDURE  
  
Pan cook green onions and bell peppers in oil.  

Add garlic.  

After a minute or two deglaze with wine.  

Add tomatoes. And garlic powder and any other spices.  

Simmer for however long you want it to be less chunky. Deglaze again if necessary with wine. If you want it to simmer for a really long time you could also add some pasta water.  

Add cheese and stir well as it melts in.  
  
If using already-cooked meat put that in there.  

Then you can add pasta if the pan is big enough or dump the sauce/meat on top of pasta in a bowl.
