
Using Italian cold cuts for cooking w/ tomato and/or vodka sauce with pasta.  

Capicola -- possibly better using it like sausage. Chopped up. Cooked in the pan after the onions and garlic if the sauce is already made?  
- Maybe fry that first, set aside, and then do all the rest of the cooking and add it back in at the end?  
  
Prosciutto -- maybe better incorporated into the sauce early on? Finely diced.
