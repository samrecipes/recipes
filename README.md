# Recipes

No code. Just food recipes.

Unless otherwise specified, all my cooking with onions and garlic follows this procedure:

- Heat olive oil or coconut oil or butter in a pan.
- Add onions and/or shallots, let them simmer for awhile, you can even wait until they caramelize.
- Add carrots (if any) immediately after onions if you want them to soften up (both the carrots and onions will add some sweetness to whatever we're making).
- Add in the garlic _only_ after the onions have had at least a few minutes.
