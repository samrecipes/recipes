# Recipes

No code. Just food recipes.

Unless otherwise specified, all my cooking with onions and garlic follows this procedure:

- Heat extra virgin olive oil or coconut oil or butter in a pan.
- Add onions and/or shallots, let them simmer for awhile, you can even wait until they caramelize.
- Add carrots (if any) immediately after onions if you want them to soften up (both the carrots and onions will add some sweetness to whatever we're making).
- Add in the garlic after the onions have had at least a few minutes.
- Don't burn the garlic--after a couple minutes (at most) add the next batch of ingredients.

I don't actually measure out the cooking oils, I just throw 'em in there.
