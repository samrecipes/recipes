# Salsa

2 or 3 Roma tomatoes  
1 (14.5 oz) can petite diced tomatoes  
2 green onions (ends trimmed)  
1/3 cup chopped onion (about 1/4 of a medium)  
? minced shallots  
  
1 minced Scotch Bonnet pepper (This is much hotter than jalapeno. Maybe optionally add some jalapeno as well if it's not hot enough overall. I found that it's very hot at first and then somehow mellows out after being mixed a lot and in the fridge for a little while.)  

1 large clove garlic, minced  
2 Tbsp fresh lime juice  
1/2 tsp chili powder  
1/4 tsp ground cumin  
1/2 tsp granulated sugar (optional)  
? Salt (needed more)  
? black pepper  
1/3 cup fresh cilantro (since my roommate doesn't like cilantro, I omit this and just add some dried cilantro on my own meals)
